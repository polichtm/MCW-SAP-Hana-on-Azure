# SAP HANA on Azure

Contoso, a pharmaceutical company, wants to significantly reduce server and storage hardware in their own datacenters to minimize IT related costs. The leadership asked Contoso IT to look into the possibility of implementing its SAP HANA environment in cloud. Contoso also wants to dramatically simplify the process of provisioning Azure resources, as well as installation and configuration of SAP HANA software components. Contoso IT has been relying on Ansible to manage its on-premises environment and, with the cloud migration plans, it started evaluating the use of Terraform to automate on-premises and cloud-based deployments.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to provision a highly available deployment of SAP HANA in Azure. Throughout the whiteboard design session and the hands-on lab, you will look at the planning process of deploying SAP HANA on Azure VMs. You will identify and implement Azure infrastructure components necessary to support a clustered deployment of SAP HANA. Finally, you will review and test different scenarios that involve manual and automatic failover between cluster nodes.

At the end of this workshop you will be able to better design and deploy SAP HANA on Azure. After its completion, you will be able to provision Azure infrastructure components necessary to support highly available SAP HANA deployments, configure Azure virtual machines to support highly available SAP HANA installations, implement SUSE Linux Enterprise clustering, and test high availability scenarios.

### Whiteboard design session

In this workshop, you will look at what is involved in deploying SAP HANA on Azure with the goals of designing for in-memory database performance, business continuity and flexibility as well as fully optimized total cost of ownership. 

At the end of this whiteboard design session you will be able to design SAP HANA workloads on Azure in alignment with SAP HANA certification with high availability and disaster recovery, use Azure Pricing Calculator to price the SAP HANA landscape, and present the solution to business/technical decision makers and handle Q&A with customer. 

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab you will deploy a stand-alone and highly-available SAP HANA environments in Azure by using Terraform and Ansible. Following each deployment, you will review the resulting configuration. For highly-available deployment, you will test several different failover scenarios in order to validate resiliency of the SAP HANA Pacemaker-based cluster.
