# SAP HANA on Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will step through the implementation of a single-node and highly-available SAP HANA deployments on Microsoft Azure virtual machines running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. 

After its completion, you will be able to perform single-node and highly-available SAP HANA deployments by using Terraform and Ansible, validate both types of deployments, test failover scenarios, and remove the deployed resources.

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you are working with Contoso to develop a process of implementing an automated deployment of single-node and highly-available SAP HANA instances on Azure virtual machines (VMs). Your tasks will include the preparation for the deployment process, invoking the deployment, validating the outcome of the deployment, and removal all of the deployed resources.

## Exercise 1: Implement a single-node HANA instance by using Terraform and Ansible

Duration: 120 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement a single-node deployment of SAP HANA on Azure virtual machines (VMs). Following initial configuration of Terraform-based templates, the deployment will be fully automated, including installation of all necessary SAP HANA components. 

### Task 1: Provision a Linux virtual machine hosting lab deployment tools

1.  From the lab computer, start a Web browser, navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com and sign in with credentials you will be using in this lab.

1.  In the Azure portal at <http://portal.azure.com>, start a Bash session in **Cloud Shell**.

1.  If prompted, in the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell** window, select **Bash (Linux)**.

1.  If prompted, in the **You have no storage mounted** window, select **Create storage**.

1.  In the **Bash** session in the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to select the Azure subscription in which you will provision the Azure resources in this lab (replace the `[subscription_ID]` placeholder with the value of the subscriptionID parameter of the Azure subscription you intend to use in this lab):

    ```sh
    az account set --subscription '[subscription_ID]'
    ```

1.  In the **Bash** session in the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to create an Azure resource group that will contain the Azure VM hosting the lab deployment tools (replace the `[Azure_region]` placeholder with the name of the Azure region you intend to use for all Azure resources you will deploy in this lab):

    ```sh
    LOCATION='[Azure region]'
    RGNAME='mcw-hana-on-azure-cli-RG'
    az group create --location $LOCATION --name $RGNAME
    ```

1.  In the **Bash** session in the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to download into the Cloud Shell home directory the Azure Resource Manager template and the corresponding parameters file you will use for provisioning of the Azure VM that will host the lab deployment tools:

    ```sh
    rm ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.json -f
    rm ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.parameters.json -f

    wget https://github.com/polichtm/MCW-SAP-HANA-on-Azure/tree/master/Hands-on%20lab/labfiles/sap-hana/templates/ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.json
    wget https://github.com/mpolicht/sap-hana/tree/master/templates/ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.parameters.json
    ```

1.  In the **Bash** session in the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to provision the Azure VM that will host the lab deployment tools:

    ```sh
    az deployment group create \
    --resource-group $RGNAME \
    --template-file ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.json \
    --parameters @ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.parameters.json
    ```

    > **Note**: When prompted, specify a user name and its password that you will use to sign in to the operating system of the Azure VM.

    > **Note**: Wait until the provisioning completes. This should take about 3 minutes.

1.  In the **Bash** session in the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to display the public IP address of the Azure VM you deployed in the previous step:

    ```sh
    VMNAME=$(az vm list --resource-group $RGNAME --query '[].{Name:name}' -o tsv)
    az vm show --show-details --resource-group $RGNAME --name $VMNAME --query publicIps -o tsv
    ```

1.  From your computer, start the SSH client and connect via SSH to the newly provisioned Azure VM via the public IP address you identified in the previous step. When prompted to sign in, authentiate by using the credentials you provided during provisioning.

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to update the package manager list of available packages and their versions (confirm when prompted whether to proceed):

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to upgrade the versions of the local packages (confirm when prompted whether to proceed):

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to install Azure CLI:

    ```sh
    curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to install the latest version of Terraform:

    ```sh
    TER_VER='0.13.4'
    wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/${TER_VER}/terraform_${TER_VER}_linux_amd64.zip
    sudo apt install unzip
    unzip terraform_${TER_VER}_linux_amd64.zip
    sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to install jq (confirm when prompted whether to proceed):

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install jq
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to install Ansible (confirm when prompted whether to proceed):

    ```sh
    sudo apt install ansible
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to install Git:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```

### Task 2: Deploy a single-node HANA instance by using Terraform and Ansible

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM you provisioned in the previous task, run the following to generate the SSH key pair that will be used to secure access to Linux Azure VMs deployed in this lab (when prompted to specify the location of the file in which to save the key and to specify the passphrase protecting the content of the file, press the **Enter** key three times): 

     ```sh
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
     ``` 

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM you provisioned in the previous task, run the following to clone the code you will use to perform the deployment and switch to the directory containing the deployment files:

    ```sh
    mkdir ~/projects/ && cd $_
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana.git
    cd sap-hana/
    ```

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to extend the **$PATH** environment variable to include the location of the utility scripts that are part of the cloned repo:

    ```sh
    source util/source_path.sh
    ```

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM you provisioned in the previous task, run the following to authenticate to the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription:

    ```sh
    az login
    ```

1.  Note the code displayed as the output of the previous command, switch to your lab computer, open another tab in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to [the Microsoft Device Login page](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin) and, when prompted, enter the code and select **Next**.

1.  When prompted, sign in with credentials you are using in this lab and close the browser tab.

1.  Switch back to the SSH session to the Azure VM you provisioned in the previous task and run the following to identify the current Azure subscription:

    ```sh
    check_subscription.sh
    ```

1.  If needed, in the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to select the Azure subscription in which you will provision the Azure resources in this lab (replace the `[subscription_ID]` placeholder with the value of the subscriptionID parameter of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab):

    ```sh
    az account set --subscription '[subscription_ID]':
    ```

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to create an Azure AD service principal that will be used during deployment:

    ```sh
    create_service_principal.sh sp-hanav2sn
    ```

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to export the environment variables designating the service principal you created in the previous step:

    ```sh
    source set-sp.sh
    ```

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to download into the current directory the Azure Resource Manager template and the corresponding parameters file you will use for provisioning of the single-node SAP HANA lab environment:

    ```sh
    curl https://github.com/polichtm/MCW-SAP-HANA-on-Azure/tree/master/Hands-on%20lab/labfiles/sap-hana/templates/template-sn1.json  --output ./deploy/template_samples/template-sn1.json

### Task 3: Review the deployment of a single-node HANA instance

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to identify the private IP addresses of the **hdb1-0** Azure VM:

    ```sh
    RGNAME='hanav2-sn-RG'
    VMNAME='hdb1-0'
    az vm show --show-details --resource-group $RGNAME --name $VMNAME --query privateIps --output tsv
    ```

    > **Note**: The **hdb1-0** Azure VM has two IP addresses **10.1.1.10** and **10.1.2.10**. The first one is meant to be used for management. You will use this IP address in this exercise. 

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to connect via SSH to the Linux jumpbox VM, which public IP address you identified in the previous task (replace the `[IP_address]` placeholder with the value of the public IP address and confirm when prompted whether to proceed):

    ```sh
    ssh azureadm@[IP_address]
    ```

1.  From within the SSH session to the Linux jumpbox Azure VM, connect to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM running HANA by using its private IP address you identified earlier in this task:

    ```sh
    ssh azureadm@10.1.1.10
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to switch to the security context of the **\<sid\>adm** account and, when prompted for its password, type **Help4you** (HANA SID in the lab environment is set to **HN1**):

    ```sh
    su - hn1adm
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to identify the version of the local HANA instance:

### Task 4: Prepare for the highly-available deployment of SAP HANA

> **Note**: In the next exercise, you will implement a highly-available SAP HANA deployment. You will leverage for that purpose the SAP media downloaded in this exercise. 

1.  From the **hn1adm@hdb1-0:/hana/shared/HN1/xs/bin\>** prompt, type **exit** and press **Enter** to exit the XSA environment. 

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to switch to the security context of the **\<sid\>adm** account and, when prompted for its password, type **Help4you**:

    ```sh
    su - hn1adm
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to stop the HANA instance:

    ```sh
    hn1adm@hdb1-0:/hana/shared/HN1/xs/bin> HDB stop
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to verify that the HANA instance is no longer running:

    ```sh
    ps -le |grep hdb
    ```

    > **Note**: The output should resemble the following:

    ```sh
    hn1adm@hdb1-0:/usr/sap/HN1/HDB00> ps -le |grep hdb
    1 S  1001 13905     1  0  80   0 - 177500 -     ?        00:00:00 hdbrsutil
    1 S  1001 14314     1  0  80   0 - 177501 -     ?        00:00:00 hdbrsutil
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to shut down operating system:

    ```sh
    exit
    sudo shutdown now
    ```

    > **Note**: This will automatically terminate the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM.

1.  Within the SSH session to the Linux jumpbox Azure VM, run the following to shut down operating system:

    ```sh
    sudo shutdown now
     ```

    > **Note**: This will automatically terminate the SSH session to the Linux jumpbox Azure VM.

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM you used to perform the Terraform deployment, run the following to delete all VMs that were included in that deployment:

    ```sh
    RGNAME='hanav2-sn-RG'
    az vm delete --ids $(az vm list --resource-group $RGNAME --query "[].id" -o tsv) --yes
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the Azure VM you used to perform the Terraform deployment, run the following to delete all VM disks that were included in that deployment:

    ```sh
    az disk delete --ids $(az disk list --resource-group $RGNAME --query "[].id" -o tsv) --yes --no-wait
    ```

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM you used for Terraform deployment, run the following to clean up the working directries and files (confirm when prompted whether to proceed):

    ```sh
    terraform_v2.sh clean
    ```

## Exercise 2: Implement highly-available HANA instances by using Terraform and Ansible

Duration: 120 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement a highly-available deployment of SAP HANA on Azure virtual machines (VMs). The deployment will be divided into two fully automated parts. The first one will use Terraform to deploy Azure resources that will host SAP deployment. The second one will use Ansible to deploy and configure all of the SAP components. 

You will leverage a number of artifacts that you implemented in the first exercise of this lab, including:

-   HANA software that you uploaded to an Azure Storage account

-   SSH key pair

-   The service principal created to facilitate authentication and authorization required by Terraform to provision Azure resources.

### Task 1: Deploy highly-available Azure infrastructure by using Terraform

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM you used for Terraform deployment, run the following to extend the $PATH environment variable to include the location of the utility scripts that are part of the cloned repo:

    ```sh
    source util/source_path.sh
    ```

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to export the environment variables designating the service principal you created in the previous exercise:

    ```sh
    source set-sp.sh
    ```

1.  In the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following to download into the current directory the Azure Resource Manager template and the corresponding parameters file you will use for provisioning of the single-node SAP HANA lab environment:

    ```sh
    curl https://github.com/polichtm/MCW-SAP-HANA-on-Azure/tree/master/Hands-on%20lab/labfiles/sap-hana/templates/template-ha1.json  --output ./deploy/template_samples/template-ha1.json
    ```

    > **Note**: Once the deployment completes, the output will include the public IP address of the Windows jumpbox VM included in the Terraform deployment, its local user name with the Administrator privileges, and its password, which you will use in the next task. 


### Task 3: Review the deployment of highly-available HANA instances

> **Note**: In this deployment, the **hdb1-0** Azure VM also has two private IP addresses **10.101.1.10** and **10.101.2.10**. The first one is meant to be used for management. You will use this IP address in this exercise. 

1.  From within the SSH session to the Linux jumpbox Azure VM, connect to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM running HANA by using its private IP address you identified earlier in this task:

    ```sh
    ssh azureadm@10.101.1.10
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to switch to the security context of the **\<sid\>adm** account and, when prompted for its password, type **Help4you**:

    ```sh
    su - hn1adm
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to sign in to the locally installed SAP HANA XS Advanced environment (when prompted, provide the password **Manager1** for the **XSA_ADMIN** user):

    ```sh
    cd /hana/shared/HN1/xs/bin
    ./xs-admin-login
    ```

1.  From the **hn1adm@hdb1-0:/hana/shared/HN1/xs/bin\>** prompt, run the following to identify the URL of the XSA Cockpit:

    ```sh
    xs apps | grep xsa-cockpit
    ```

    > **Note**: The output should resemble the following:

    ```sh
    xsa-cockpit                   STARTED           1/1         512 MB    <unlimited>   https://hdb1-0.fyz5ci1dm3lurnjzgn2dsvpb0g.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:51025
    ```

    > **Note**: Take the note of the URL designating the access point of xsa-cockpit. You will need it later in this exercise.

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to identify the **default_domain** and **api_url** XSA parameters:

    ```sh
    cat /hana/shared/HN1/global/hdb/custom/config/xscontroller.ini
    ```

    > **Note**: The output should include the following:

    ```sh
    [communication]
    default_domain = hdb1-0.fyz5ci1dm3lurnjzgn2dsvpb0g.bx.internal.cloudapp.net
    api_url = https://hdb1-0.fyz5ci1dm3lurnjzgn2dsvpb0g.bx.internal.cloudapp.net:30030
    ```

1.  Switch to the lab computer and initiate a Remote Desktop session to the Windows Server jumpbox Azure VM **hanav2jmp-vm0** which public IP address you identified in the previous task. When prompted, sign in with the credentials, also provided at the end of the previous task.

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to the Windows Server jumpbox Azure VM **hanav2jmp-vm0**, navigate to the **Local Server** view in the **Server Manager** window and disable **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**.

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to the Windows Server jumpbox Azure VM **hanav2jmp-vm0**, open the **hosts** file located in **C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc** in Notepad.

1.  Add the following entries to the host file, save your changes, and close the file:

    ```
    10.101.2.4	hdbha
    10.101.2.10	hdb1-0
    10.101.2.11	hdb1-1
    ```

    > **Note**: `10.101.2.4` is the IP address assigned to the front end of the Azure Internal Load Balancer that distributes network traffic to the HANA cluster hosted on two Azure VMs **hdb1-0** and **hdb1-1**.

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to the Windows Server jumpbox Azure VM **hanav2jmp-vm0**, start **Internet Explorer**, and browse to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). When prompted, sign in with the credentials you are using in this lab.

1.  In the Azure portal, search for and select **Proximity placement groups** and, on the **Proximity placement groups** blade, select the **hanav2-ha-ppg** entry.

1.  On the **hanav2-ha-ppg** blade, note that the proximity placement group contains the **HN1_hdb-avset** availability set along with both Azure VMs **hdb1-0** and **hdb1-1**, operating as the HANA cluster nodes.

    > **Note**: The proximity placement group ensures that the latency of replication between the cluster nodes is minimized.

1.  In the Azure portal, search for and select **Network security groups** and, on the **Network security groups** blade, select the entry representing the **nsg-db** network security group in the **hanav2-ha-RG** resource group.

    > **Note**: Make sure that you select the **nsg-db** network security group in the **hanav2-ha-RG** resource group (rather than the one in the **hanav2-sn-RG** resource group).

    > **Note**: The **nsg-db** network security group restrict connectivity to the Azure VMs hosting the HANA databases. In order to proceed with further testing within the lab environment, you need to allow incoming traffic from the jumpbox VM running Windows Server 2019 and from load balancer probes (which are currently denied) to the virtual network hosting the load balancer Azure VMs running HANA.

1.  On the **nsg-db** blade, select **Inbound security rules** and then select **+ Add**. 

1.  On the **Add inbound security rule** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values) and select **Add**:

    | Setting | Value |

    | Name | **allow-lab-traffic** |

1.  In the Azure portal, search for and select **Load balancers** and, on the **Load balancers** blade, select the **HN1_hdb-alb** entry. 

    > **Note**: The **HN1_hdb-alb** load balancer provides load balancing for connections targeting Azure VMs hosting the HANA databases. In order to proceed with testing in the lab environment, you need to modify the backend pool of the load balancer.

1.  On the **HN1_hdb-alb \| Load balancing rules** blade, select **Backend pools**. 

1.  On the **HN1_hdb-alb \| Backend pools** blade, select the **HN1_hdbAlb-bePool** entry.

1.  On the **HN1_hdbAlb-bePool** blade, in the **Virtual machines** section, select the **hdb1-0** and the **hdb1-1** checkboxes and then select **Remove**.

1.  On the **HN1_hdbAlb-bePool** blade, in the **Virtual machines** section, select **Add**.

1.  On the **Add virtual machines to backend pool** blade, select the entry referencing **hdb1-0-admin-nic-ip (10.1.1.10)** and **hdb1-1-admin-nic-ip (10.1.1.11)** and then select **Add**. 

    > **Note**: Make sure to select the IP Configuration entries that reference IP addresses on the **10.1.1.0/24** subnet. This is necessary to allow for the traffic originating from the Windows Server jumpbox Azure VM to reach the backend pool VMs.

1.  Back on the **HN1_hdbAlb-bePool** blade, select **Save**.

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to the Windows Server jumpbox Azure VM **hanav2jmp-vm0**, start **Internet Explorer**, and browse to **https://hdb1-0:7630**. 

1.  Disregard the **This site is not secure** error message, select **More information**, and then select **Go on to the webpage (not recommended)**. 

    > **Note**: Ignore any messages indicating problems with security certificate of the target website. This is expected in the lab environment. 

1.  On the **SUSE Hawk Sign in** page, sign in as **hacluster** with the password **ASecurePa55w0rd**.

1.  Once you signed in, review the **Resources** tab on the **Status** page.

    > **Note**: Review the output, including the **sql port** entry, which allows you to identify the target HANA instance. Verify that it includes the reference to **hdb1-1**.

    > **Note**: At this point, the **msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB00** resource uses only a single-node (**hdb1-1**). To allow failback to **hdb1-0**, you need to first remove the constraints that were generated automatically when you initiated the migration task. 

1.  To remove constraints, use the vertical menu on the left-hand side of the **SUSE Hawk Status** to switch to the **Edit Configuration** page and display its **Constraints** tab. 

    ![The Constraints tab is selected on the Edit Configuration page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-SAPHANAonAzureimages/media/ex2task7_hawk_post_migration_constraints.png "Edit Configuration page")

    > **Note**: Ban and prefer location constraints are generated automatically during migration operation in order to prevent unintended failback to the original cluster node. However, such constraints should be removed once the original node is available to host cluster resources. 

    > **Note**: Make sure not to accidentally remove other constraints.  
    
1.  From the **Constraints** page, delete the **cli-ban-msl\_SAPHana\_HN1\_HDB00-on-hdb1-0** Location constraint.

    ![Under Operations, the Delete constraint icon is selected for cli-ban-msl\_SAPHana\_HN1\_HDB00-on-hdb1-0.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-SAPHANAonAzureimages/media/ex2task7_hawk_migrated_delete_ban_constraint.png "Delete constraint")

1.  From the **Constraints** page, delete the **cli-prefer-msl\_SAPHana\_HN1\_HDB00** Location constraint.

    ![Under Operations, the Delete constraint icon is selected for cli-prefer-msl\_SAPHana\_HN1\_HDB00-on-hdb1-0.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-SAPHANAonAzureimages/media/ex2task7_hawk_migrated_delete_prefer_constraint.png "Delete constraint")

1.  Switch back to the **SUSE Hawk Status** page at **https://hdb1-0:7630**, and note that the icons representing constraints are no longer present, however, the console displays an error message indicating a failure of the start operation for resource rsc_SAPHana_HN1_HDB00 on node hdb1-0. 

    > **Note**: The **msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB00** resource does not automatically add **hdb1-0** as the passive node, as indicated by the error message. This is expected, since the **AUTOMATED_REGISTER** parameter of the resource is set to **false**.

    ```sh
    su - hn1adm
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to ensure that the HANA instance is stopped:

    ```sh
    sapcontrol -nr 00 -function StopWait 600 10
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to re-configure the local HANA instance as secondary

    ```sh
    hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=hdb1-1 --remoteInstance=00 --replicationMode=sync --name=SITE1
    ```

1.  Within the SSH session to the **hdb1-0** Azure VM, run the following to switch back to root context and clean up the failed state:

    ```sh
    exit
    sudo crm resource cleanup msl_SAPHana_HN1_HDB00 hdb1-0
    ```
   
1.  Switch to the **SUSE Hawk Status** page, and verify that the status indicator of the **SAPHana** clustered resource changed initially to a question mark and then to a blue dot, with hdb1-0 as the master (you might need to wait a few minutes for the interface to refresh).

    ![The Resources tab is selected on the Status page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-SAPHANAonAzureimages/media/ex2task7_hawk_post_migration_and_cleanup_question_mark.png "Status page")
