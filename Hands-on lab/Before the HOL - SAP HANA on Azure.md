# SAP HANA on Azure before the hands-on-lab setup guide

## Requirements

-   A Microsoft Azure subscription

-   A lab computer running Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 with:

    -   Access to Microsoft Azure

    -   Access to the SAP HANA installation media (requires an SAP Online Service System account)

   > **Note**: The lab does not require locally installed software. Azure CLI and Terraform tasks are performed by using Cloud Shell in the Azure portal.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

To complete this lab, you must verify that your account has sufficient permissions to the Azure subscription that you intend to use to deploy all required Azure resources. You also need to identify the availability of the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server image that you will use to deploy Azure VMs.

### Task 1: Validate the owner role assignment in the Azure subscription

1.  From the lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the Azure portal at <http://portal.azure.com>, sign in with credentials you will be using in this lab. 

1.  In the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Subscriptions** and, in the list of results, select **Subscriptions**.

1.  On the **Subscriptions** blade, select the name of the subscription you intend to use for this lab.

1.  On the subscription blade, select **Access control (IAM)**.

1.  Switch to the **Role assignments** tab, review the list of role assignments, and verify that your user account has the Owner role assigned to it.

### Task 2: Validate availability of the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server image 

1.  In the Azure portal at <http://portal.azure.com>, select the **Cloud Shell** icon.

1.  If prompted, in the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell** window, select **Bash (Linux)**.

1.  If prompted, in the **You have no storage mounted** window, select **Create storage**.

1.  Once the storage account gets provisioned, at the Bash prompt, run the following: where the `<location>` placeholder designates the target Azure region that you intend to use for this lab (e.g. `eastus`), and verify the output includes an existing image:

    ```sh
    az vm image list --location <location> --publisher SUSE --offer SLES-SAP --sku 12-SP3 --all --output table
    ``` 

    > **Note**: To identify the names of Azure regions, in the **Cloud Shell**, at the Bash prompt, run `az account list-locations --query '[].name' --output tsv`
     
### Task 3: Validate sufficient number of vCPU cores

1.  In the Azure portal at <http://portal.azure.com>, in the **Cloud Shell**, at the Bash prompt, run the following: where the `<location>` placeholder designates the target Azure region that you intend to use for this lab (e.g. `eastus`):

    ```sh
    az vm list-usage --location <location> --query "[?localName == 'Standard DSv2 Family vCPUs' || localName == 'Standard ESv3 Family vCPUs'].{VMFamily:localName, currentValue:currentValue, Limit:limit}" --output table
    ``` 
   
1.  Review the output of the command executed in the previous step and ensure that you have at least 6 available vCPUs in the **Standard DSv2 Family** VM family and at least 24 available vCPUs in the **Standard ESv3 Family** in the target Azure region.

1.  If the number of vCPUs is not sufficient, in the Azure portal, navigate back to the subscription blade, and select **Usage + quotas**. 

1.  On the subscription's **Usage + quotas** blade, select **Request Increase**.

1.  On the **Basic** blade, specify the following and select **Next: Solutions >**:

    -   Issue type: **Service and subscription limits (quotas)**

    -   Subscription: the name of the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.

    -   Quota type: **Compute-VM (cores-vCPUs) subscription limit increases**

    -   Support plan: the name of the support plan associated with the target subscription.

1.  On the **Details** blade, select the **Provide details** link.

1.  On the **Quota details** blade, specify the following and select **Save and continue**:

    -   Deployment model: **Resource Manager**

    -   Location: the target Azure region you intend to use in this lab.

    -   Types: **Standard**

    -   Standard: **DSv2 Series** 
    
    -   New vCPU Limit: the new limit

    -   Standard: **ESv3 Series**

    -   New vCPU Limit: the new limit

1.  Back on the **Details** blade, specify the following and select **Next: Review + create >**:

    -   Severity: **C - Minimal impact**

    -   Preferred contact method: choose your preferred option and provide your contact details
    
1.  On the **Review + create** blade, select **Create**.

   > **Note**: It might take a few days for quota increase requests to be completed.

### Task 4: Identify SAP binaries

1.  From the lab computer, start a Web browser, navigate to **SAP Software Downloads** at https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter/ and log on using your SAP Online Service System account.

1.  In the **SAP Software Download** portal, verify that you have access to the following software packages:

    -   SAPCAR 7.21 SAPCAR for Linux x86_64 (SAPCAR_1311-80000935.EXE)

    -   SAPCAR 7.21 Windows on x64 64bit (SAPCAR_1311-80000938.EXE)

    -   SAP HANA DATABASE 1.00 Linux on x86_64 64bit Maintenance Revision 122.30 (SPS12) for HANA DB 1.00 (IMDB_SERVER100_122_30-10009569.SAR)

    -   Support Package SAP HOST AGENT 7.21 SP36 Linux on x86_64 64bit (SAPHOSTAGENT36_36-20009394.SAR)

    -   SAP HANA STUDIO 2 Windows on x64 64bit Revision 122.030 for SAP HANA STUDIO 2 (IMC_STUDIO2_122_30-80000323.SAR)
  
    > **Note**: The packages listed above might be superseded by newer versions. If so, ensure to adjust accordingly all references to the names of these packages in this task. To find appropriate packages, you can take advantage of the search functionality of the **SAP Software Downloads** portal. Use the first part of each package (up to the first hyphen) as the search criterion and, in the search results, identify the type that matches the intended platform (either Linux x86_64 or Windows 64-bit).


You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
